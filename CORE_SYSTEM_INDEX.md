# IMPORTANT

This document is the official engineering reference for the project.

Every new development session MUST begin by reading this document before writing a single line of code.

No assumption is allowed.

No file may be modified without understanding its dependencies.

If information is missing, STOP and ask.

Never invent architecture.

Never invent routes.

Never invent database structures.

The repository is always the primary source of truth.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Name

CORE SYSTEM

Full Name

ClinicSaaS™ Multi-Tenant Clinic Management Platform

Project Type

Software as a Service (SaaS)

Current State

Under active development.

Target

A complete operating system for aesthetic clinics, dermatology clinics, laser centers and expandable to other medical specialties.

---

# PROJECT PHILOSOPHY

CORE SYSTEM is NOT:

- Appointment booking software.
- CRM only.
- Medical records only.
- Billing software only.

CORE SYSTEM combines:

- Clinic Operations
- Medical Workflow
- Reception
- Queue Management
- Scheduling
- Billing
- Inventory
- Patient Journey
- Staff Evaluation
- Business Intelligence
- Analytics
- Subscription Management
- Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

Every future decision must preserve this philosophy.

---

# CORE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

These rules are mandatory.

1.

The system remains SaaS permanently.

No architectural decision may convert it into a single-clinic application.

---

2.

Every clinic is an isolated tenant.

No clinic may access another clinic's data.

Tenant isolation is mandatory.

---

3.

Database is the single source of truth.

Business logic must never duplicate database rules.

---

4.

Architecture is more important than speed.

Never choose shortcuts that weaken scalability.

---

5.

Every solution must be scalable.

If the solution only works today, reject it.

---

6.

Backward compatibility must always be preserved.

---

7.

Never break working code to solve another problem.

---

8.

Every modification must be justified.

---

9.

Never modify files that you do not fully understand.

---

10.

If repository code conflicts with assumptions:

Repository always wins.

---

# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

Current Phase

Phase 1

Foundation

Status

NOT CLOSED

Reason

Authentication works.

Database exists.

Subscription bootstrap exists.

Dashboard routing is unstable.

Middleware requires final validation.

JWT Claims require validation.

RLS requires production verification.

Dashboard cannot yet be considered production ready.

No Phase 2 development may begin until Phase 1 is officially completed.

---

# CURRENT TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend

- Next.js App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

Backend

- Supabase

Authentication

- Supabase Auth

Database

- PostgreSQL

Hosting

- Vercel

Repository

- GitHub

Development Environment

- GitHub Codespaces

---

# PROJECT DIRECTORY RULES

The repository is the only authoritative reference.

Documentation never overrides code.

Every path must be verified inside the repository.

Never guess folder names.

Never recreate folders.

Never duplicate routes.

Never create "temporary" folders.

---

# ROUTING RULES

Current dashboard route

src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx

This is the official dashboard page.

The following route is considered INVALID unless the repository changes:

src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx

This mistake already happened during development.

It caused multiple routing failures.

Before modifying routing:

Verify repository structure.

Do not assume.

---

# DEVELOPMENT RULES

Before editing any file:

Read it completely.

Read every imported dependency.

Understand where it is used.

Understand what depends on it.

Only then modify it.

Never edit files blindly.

---

# MODIFICATION POLICY

Before changing any file the developer MUST answer:

What does this file do?

Who imports it?

What imports will break?

What routes depend on it?

What database tables depend on it?

What authentication logic depends on it?

What middleware depends on it?

If these answers are unavailable:

STOP.

Ask.

Do not modify.

---

# FILE CREATION POLICY

Never create new files unless ALL conditions are met.

Condition 1

No existing file already performs the same task.

Condition 2

The new file integrates correctly with the project.

Condition 3

The file naming follows project conventions.

Condition 4

Dependencies are verified.

Condition 5

Repository owner approves.

Otherwise:

Do not generate files.

---

# DATABASE POLICY

The database already exists.

Never recreate it.

Never redesign it.

Never generate schema from imagination.

Always inspect the current schema first.

Existing objects include:

Tables

Foreign Keys

Indexes

Functions

Triggers

Policies

RLS

JWT Hook

These are considered production assets.

Changes require verification.

---

# AUTHENTICATION POLICY

Authentication uses:

Supabase Auth

Project users are created through the official signup flow.

Authentication must never bypass Supabase.

Never store passwords manually.

Never duplicate authentication tables.

---

# MULTI TENANT POLICY

Every business entity belongs to one tenant.

Tenant isolation is mandatory.

Every protected query must respect tenant boundaries.

No exception.

---

# SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

Project type:

SaaS

Every clinic owns exactly one active subscription.

Registration starts a free trial.

Trial duration

14 days.

When the trial expires

Clinic access is suspended unless activated.

Activation occurs only through Super Admin.

Subscriptions are part of the architecture.

They are NOT optional.

---

# SUPER ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES

Only Super Admin may

Activate subscriptions.

Reactivate expired clinics.

Suspend clinics.

Manage subscription lifecycle.

Override tenant status.

No clinic administrator may perform these actions.

---

# PROJECT OWNERSHIP

The project owner is NOT a programmer.

Therefore:

Every explanation must be written in simple language.

Avoid unnecessary technical jargon.

Explain decisions before implementation.

Never assume programming knowledge.
